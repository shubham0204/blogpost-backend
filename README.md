### Security

- [x] [Databases use UUIDs as primary keys](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-uuid/), instead of consecutive integers to
 avoid incremental access of entities if a table is compromised in an attack

- [x] [All random UUIDs are generated with cryptographically safe](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/39186/what-does-it-mean-for-a-random-number-generator-to-be-cryptographically-secure)
RNGs i.e. with `os.urandom`

- [ ] Rate limiters are installed to each endpoint to prevent 
brute-force and DDoS attacks

### Deployment

- [x] Docker Compose based deployment
- [ ] Descriptive logs for FastAPI endpoints
- [ ] Host FastAPI docs on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Export Postman collection
- [ ] Simulate backend with Postman Runs
